# Introduction to Deep Learning for Particle Physics

Welcome! 
This is a repository of a gentle introduction to deep learning using particle physics data. 

## What is this repository for?

This repo is intended for those who are interested in both deep learning and physics, but do not know where to start. 
This repo consists of four notebooks and all are written in python. 
Starting from the data exploration, we will configure Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and ResNet, compare and discuss the results.

## Table of Contents 

### Part 1 - Overview of ECAL and Data Exploration `EGamma_ML.ipynb`
### Part 2 - ANN `EGamma_ANN.ipynb`
### Part 3 - CNN and ResNet `EGamma_CNN.ipynb`
### Part 4 - Summary and Conclusion `EGamma_summary.ipynb`


## How to run this project
The dataset used in this project is not publicly avaiable, so you will not be able to run the entire project. 
However, you can still read and grasp the idea and theories behind particle collision.

For those who have access to dataset (CERN specific), please clone or folk this repo to run. 

## Credits

The base of this project was created by Kyungmin Park (https://github.com/kyungminparkdrums/EGamma.git) (Carnegie Mellon University), and some tastes were added by Manami Kanemura (Northeastern University). 
The entire project was directed by Michael Andrews and Professor Manfred Paulini at Carnegie Mellon University.
